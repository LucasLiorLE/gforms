# How to use the script

To get started with running the scripts for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Google Sheet:**
   - Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com).
   - Create a new spreadsheet or open an existing one.

2. **Add and Edit Scripts:**
   - In the Google Sheet, click on `Extensions` in the menu.
   - Select `Apps Script` from the dropdown.
   - This will open the Google Apps Script editor where you can paste or modify your scripts.

3. **Create a Google Form:**
   - Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com).
   - Create a new form or open an existing one.

Make sure your Google Form and Google Sheet are properly connected if needed, as per your script requirements. 
You might need to edit the name of certain variables if you want to use the scripts for other purposes, because it needs to be exact!
